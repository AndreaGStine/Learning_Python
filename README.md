This project consists of four directories, one of which has been partially censored to avoid search results:

Algorithms Notes: My notes/projects from an algorithms class. Most relevant: 
- Sorting_Lists.py, which contains a fair collection of self-written sorting algorithms.

Basic Python: My notes/projects from an entry programming class. Most relevant:
- graphy.py, where I construct a class for undirected, directed, and weighted graphs
- random_walk.py, where I construct additive, multiplicative, and graph random walks

Pr-j-ct --l-r: My solutions to some problems from https://projecteuler.net/about 
These are included for demonstration purposes of my coding abilities and for educational purposes. 
Please do not use them to bypass solving the problems for yourself.

Python For Data Structures: My notes/projects from a data structures class. Most relevant:
- poker.py, likely-abandoned project to make a functional no-UI poker app
- algebraic_structures.py, likely-abandoned project to construct classes for basic algebraic structures (magma, semigroup, monoid, group, ring, etc.)
